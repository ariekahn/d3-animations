It has long been observed that modular VLSI circuits demonstrate an isometric scaling relationship between the number of processing elements and the number of connections, known as Rent's rule, which is related to the dimensionality of the circuit's interconnect topology and its logical capacity. We show that human brain structural networks, and the nervous system of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>, also obey Rent's rule, and exhibit some degree of hierarchical modularity.

Overexpression of Dlk1-Dio3 miRNAs early in reprogramming reduces reprogramming efficiency, suggesting the observed downregulation of these miRNAs may contribute to reprogramming. As reprogramming progresses, fewer miRNAs show changes in expression, but those changes are generally of greater magnitude.

However, these two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because few tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously considering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of community detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer) annotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model.

Yet, no direct evidence exists for a relationship between brain network controllability and cognitive control performance. Here, we address this gap by constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor imaging data acquired in 125 healthy adult individuals. We define a simplified model of brain dynamics and simulate network control to quantify modal and boundary controllability, which together describe complementary features of a region's theoretically predicted preference to drive the brain into different cognitive states. We observe that individual differences in these control features derived from structural connectivity are significantly correlated with individual differences in cognitive control performance, as measured by a continuous performance attention test, a color/shape switching task, the Stroop inhibition task, and a spatial n-back working memory task. Indeed, control hubs like anterior cingulate are distinguished from default mode and frontal association areas in terms of the relationship between their control properties and individual differences in cognitive function.

Here, we apply graph theoretic principles to quantify hierarchical folding patterns in high-resolution chromatin topology maps. We discover that TADs can be accurately detected using a Louvain-like locally greedy algorithm to maximize network modularity. By varying a resolution parameter in the modularity quality function, we accurately partition the mouse genome across length scales into a hierarchical nested structure of network communities exhibiting a wide range of sizes. To distinguish high probability subTADs from the full detected set, we developed and applied a new hierarchical spatial variance minimization method. Moreover, we identified a large number of dynamically altered communities between pluripotent embryonic stem cells and multipotent neural progenitor cells. Cell type specific boundaries correlate with trends in dynamic occupancy of the architectural protein CTCF, thereby validating their biological relevance. Together, these data demonstrate the utility of metrics from network science in quantifying a nested hierarchy of dynamic 3D chromatin communities across length scales.

Yet, a systems level understanding of these patterns (or networks) has remained elusive, in part due to variable electrode placement and sparse cortical coverage. Here, we address these challenges by constructing inter-regional ECoG networks from multi-subject recordings, demonstrate similarities between these networks and those constructed from blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging, and predict network topology from anatomical connectivity, interregional distance, and correlated gene expression patterns. Our models accurately predict out-of-sample ECoG networks and perform well even when fit to data from individual subjects, suggesting shared organizing principles across persons. In addition, we identify a set of genes whose brain-wide co-expression is highly correlated with ECoG network organization. Using gene ontology analysis, we show that these same genes are enriched for membrane and ion channel maintenance and function, suggesting a molecular underpinning of ECoG connectivity.

However, the importance of sparse areas of the network, or knowledge gaps, remains unexplored. Here we create a semantic feature network in which words correspond to nodes and in which connections correspond to semantic similarity. We develop a new analytical approach built on principles of applied topology to query the prevalence of knowledge gaps, which we propose manifest as cavities within the network. We detect topological cavities of multiple dimensions in the growing semantic feature network of children ages 16 to 30 months. The pattern of cavity appearance matches that of a constrained null model, created by predefining the affinity of each node for connections. Furthermore, when word acquisition time is computed from children of mothers with differing levels of education, we find that despite variation at the word level, the global organization as measured by persistent homology remains comparable. We show that topological properties of a node correlate with filling in cavities better than simple lexical properties such as the length and frequency of the corresponding word.

To detect and quantify these topological features we must turn to methods from algebraic topology that encode data as a simplicial complex built of sets of interacting nodes called simplices. On this substrate, we can then use the relations between simplices and higher-order connectivity to expose cavities within the complex, thereby summarizing its topological nature.

While experimental evidence supporting the presence of scale-free avalanches in neuronal activity characteristic of a critical state has been steadily accumulating, the interpretation of these data as evidence for critical brain dynamics has simultaneously been questioned (see [1, 2] and references therein). From a neuroscientific point of view, the principal appeal of the criticality hypothesis is that critical dynamics have been repeatedly linked to improved information processing, including increased memory capacity, dynamic range, and computational power (see [2] and references therein). Thus far, however, the role that neuronal avalanches-whether hallmarks of criticality or not-might play in complex mental processes such as learning and memory has remained largely unexplored.

In this study, we compare and contrast two types of biological distribution networks: mycelial fungi and the vasculature system on the surface of rodent brains. Both systems are alike in that they must route resources efficiently, but they are also inherently distinct in terms of their growth mechanisms, and in that fungi are not attached to a larger organism and must often function in unregulated and varied environments. We begin by uncovering a common organizational principle--Rentian scaling--that manifests as hierarchical network layout in both physical and topological space. Simulated models of distribution networks optimized for transport in the presence of fluctuations are also shown to exhibit this feature in their embedding, with similar scaling exponents. However, we also find clear differences in how the fungi and vasculature balance tradeoffs in material cost, efficiency, and robustness. While the vasculature appear well optimized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency, the fungi tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks.

Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on these learning processes.

Based on a classification of the user's intention from the user's underlying neural activity, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct interactions with the external environment while bypassing the traditional effector of the musculoskeletal system. Despite the enormous potential of BCIs, there are still a number of challenges that limit their societal impact, ranging from the correct decoding of a human's thoughts, to the application of effective learning strategies. Despite several important engineering advances, the basic neuroscience behind these challenges remains poorly explored. Indeed, BCIs involve complex dynamic changes related to neural plasticity at a diverse range of spatiotemporal scales. One promising antidote to this complexity lies in network science, which provides a natural language in which to model the organizational principles of brain architecture and function as manifest in its interconnectivity. Here, we briefly review the main limitations currently affecting BCIs, and we offer our perspective on how they can be addressed by means of network theoretic approaches.

In a first validation of our model, we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical stimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on energy requirements.

Yet as a whole, this endeavor more closely resembles a complex system of natural computation, in which information is obtained, generated, and disseminated more effectively than would be possible by individuals acting in isolation. Currently, the structure of this integrated and innovative landscape of scientific ideas is not well understood. Here we use tools from network science to map the landscape of interconnected research topics covered in the multidisciplinary journal PNAS since 2000. We construct networks in which nodes represent topics of study and edges give the degree to which topics occur in the same papers. The network displays small-world architecture, with dense connectivity within scientific clusters and sparse connectivity between clusters. Notably, clusters tend not to align with assigned article classifications, but instead contain topics from various disciplines. Using a temporal graph, we find that small-worldness has increased over time, suggesting growing efficiency and integration of ideas. Finally, we define a novel measure of interdisciplinarity, which is positively associated with PNAS's impact factor. Broadly, this work suggests that complex and dynamic patterns of knowledge emerge from scientific research, and that structures reflecting intellectual integration may be beneficial for obtaining scientific insight.</div><div class=\"gsh_csp\">Subjects: Social and Information Networks (cs.

Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks estimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample of 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these networks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-versus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal controllability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have higher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore, average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both higher in males, are negatively related to executive function.

We propose a mathematical framework for studying the efficiency of spatially embedded whole-brain states reflected in functional MRI, and demonstrate its utility in describing how human subjects learn the values of novel objects.

To address this limitation, we exercise a multi-scale extension of a community detection technique known as modularity maximization, and we apply the tool to both synthetic graphs and graphs derived from human structural and functional imaging data.

In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviors such as synchronization. While descriptions of these behaviors are important, they are only a first step towards understanding the relationship between network topology and system behavior, and harnessing that relationship to optimally control the system's function. Here, we use linear network control theory to analytically relate the topology of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. As opposed to the numerical computations of control energy, our accurate closed-form expressions yield general structural features in networks that require significantly more or less energy to control, providing topological principles for the design and modification of network behavior. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from drosophila, mouse, and human brains.

This problem is particularly relevant for studies of human brain development where important variables (such as participant age) are correlated with data quality. Nevertheless, the impact of head motion on estimates of structural connectivity derived from diffusion tractography methods remains poorly characterized. Here, we evaluated the impact of in-scanner head motion on structural connectivity using a sample of 949 participants (ages 8-23 years old) who passed a rigorous quality assessment protocol for diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) acquired as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Structural brain networks were constructed for each participant using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We hypothesized that subtle variation in head motion would systematically bias estimates of structural connectivity and confound developmental inference, as observed in previous studies of functional connectivity. Even following quality assurance and retrospective correction for head motion, eddy currents, and field distortions, in-scanner head motion significantly impacted the strength of structural connectivity in a consistency- and length-dependent manner. Specifically, increased head motion was associated with reduced estimates of structural connectivity for high-consistency network edges, which included both short- and long-range connections.

Generally, relative subgraph expression during the Stroop task is significantly associated with relative subgraph expression during the Navon task (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1, \u03c1= 0.97, p= 1.3 x 10\u2212 7), implying that subgraphs collectively follow similar rules of dynamical expression during the Stroop and Navon tasks. However, individual subgraphs may vary in the amount they are expressed during the Stroop and Navon tasks, which is signified by the perpendicular distance between a subgraph and the shaded gray line with slope equal to one. Using paired t-tests and FDR correction for multiple comparisons, we compare the distribution of relative subgraph expression between Stroop and Navon tasks across subjects. We find greater positive expression during the Navon task than the Stroop task for subgraph B (t27= 4.4, p= 1.4\u00d7 10\u2212 4) and subgraph D (t27= 2.9, p= 7.0\u00d7 10\u2212 3), and we find greater negative expression during the Navon task than the Stroop task for subgraph K (t27= 5.1, p= 1.4\u00d7 10\u2212 5). Thus, the rank of a subgraph in terms of its overall expression relative to other subgraphs is similar between the Stroop and Navon tasks, but its level of expression may be different depending on the task. Specifically, we find subgraphs B and D are more strongly\u00a0\u2026</div></div>"], "author": "Ankit N Khambhati and John D Medaglia and Elisabeth A Karuza and Sharon L Thompson-Schill and Danielle S Bassett", "eprint": "https://scholar.google.comhttps://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006420&type=printable", "journal": "PLoS computational biology", "number": "8", "pages": "e1006420", "publisher": "Public Library of Science", "title": "Correction: Subgraphs of functional brain networks identify dynamical constraints of cognitive control", "url": "https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006420", "volume": "14", "year": 2018}, "id_citations": "siYpAPsAAAAJ:wMgC3FpKEyYC", "source": "citations"}, {"_filled": true, "bib": {"abstract": ["<div class=\"gsh_small\"><div class=\"gsh_csp\">Despite widespread use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in clinical practice, its mechanisms with respect to brain networks remain sparsely described.

While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n= 1012) to examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age, high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length, consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of regional homogeneity.

A particularly salient example is the ability to deduce structure from time-varying auditory and visual stimuli, enabling humans to master the rules of language and to build rich expectations of their physical environment. The broad relevance of this ability for human cognition motivates the need for a first-principles model explicating putative mechanisms. Here we propose a general framework for structural learning in the brain, composed of an evolving, high-dimensional dynamical system driven by external stimuli or internal processes. We operationalize the scenario in which humans learn the rules that generate a sequence of stimuli, rather than the exemplar stimuli themselves. We model external stimuli as seemingly disordered chaotic time series generated by complex dynamical systems; the underlying structure being deduced is then that of the corresponding chaotic attractor. This approach allows us to demonstrate and theoretically explain the emergence of five distinct phenomena reminiscent of cognitive functions:(i) learning the structure of a chaotic system purely from time series,(ii) generating new streams of stimuli from a chaotic system,(iii) switching stream generation among multiple learned chaotic systems, either spontaneously or in response to external perturbations,(iv) inferring missing data from sparse observations of the chaotic system, and (v) deciphering superimposed input from different chaotic systems.

While collaboration and citation networks highlight important contributions within the field, the roles of and relations among specific areas of study can remain quite opaque. Here, we apply techniques from network science to map the landscape of neuroimaging research documented in the journal NeuroImage over the past decade. We create a network in which nodes represent research topics, and edges give the degree to which these topics tend to be covered in tandem. The network displays small-world architecture, with communities characterized by common imaging modalities and medical applications, and with bridges that integrate these distinct subfields. Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry. The overall prevalence of a topic is unrelated to the prevalence of its neighbors, but the degree to which a topic becomes more or less popular over time is strongly related to changes in the prevalence of its neighbors.

Here we show that networks of email and private message correspondence exhibit surges of collective activity, which cannot be explained by assuming that humans act independently. Intuitively, this collective behavior could arise from complicated correlations between large groups of users, or from shared daily and weekly rhythms. Instead, we find that the network activity is quantitatively and robustly described by a maximum entropy model that depends only on simple pairwise correlations. Remarkably, we find that the functional interactions in the model, which are learned exclusively from the timing of people's actions, are closely related to the ground-truth topology of correspondence in the population.

To investigate the effect of anatomical brain organization on human task performance, we use a data-driven computational modeling approach and explore the functional effects of naturally occurring structural differences in brain networks. We construct personalized brain network models by combining anatomical connectivity estimated from diffusion spectrum imaging of individual subjects with a nonlinear model of brain dynamics. By performing computational experiments in which we measure the excitability of the global brain network and spread of synchronization following a targeted computational stimulation, we quantify how individual variation in the underlying connectivity impacts both local and global brain dynamics. We further relate the computational results to individual variability in the subjects' performance of three language-demanding tasks both before and after transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left-inferior frontal gyrus. Our results show that task performance correlates with either local or global measures of functional activity, depending on the complexity of the task.

In multichannel electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings acquired in 21 subjects during a total of 94 seizures, we apply dynamical systems stability analysis to assess the balance versus imbalance of seizure dynamics across different timescales and brain regions. Specifically, we consider a sliding time window multivariate autoregressive linear approximation of the data captured by the ECoG channels, where eigendecomposition of the estimated matrix of coefficients describes the contribution of different regions to the spatiotemporal process (eigenvectors) associated with a particular timescale (eigenvalues). Interestingly, we observe a pattern of eigenvalue evolution and slowly changing (or approximately time-invariant) eigenvectors across both seizures and subjects. The seizure-onset is marked by an increase in high frequency spatial information to which a few regions contribute for a long period. By contrast, the seizure termination is characterized by a sudden, small time period change in dynamics to which many regions contribute. As the seizure terminates, the relatively stable ictal dynamics rapidly transition into the post-ictal regime, marked by relatively fast-damping oscillations. Our methodology offers a subject-specific characterization of the spatiotemporal behavior of the seizure, providing new insights into the dynamic patterns and functional interactions between brain regions that occur over different timescales.

We treat granular materials as spatially embedded networks in which the nodes (particles) are connected by weighted edges obtained from contact forces. Using community detection techniques, we identify local 2D geographic domains composed of particles that exert strong forces on one another. We subsequently develop and apply a novel spatial null model constrained by the contact network to extract chain-like structures reminiscent of force chains.

In the second study, we therefore hypothesized that the brain functions on a balanced platform of maximum efficiency for minimum cost, and that the successfulness of this optimization predicts the cognitive ability of the system. Frequency specific functional networks were again derived from the MEG data of 28 healthy controls and 29 people with schizophrenia taken during a working memory task.

WM is an essential component of the executive system, allowing for information to be held in a short-term buffer for further processing. Decreased WM capacity has been associated with decreased capacity for verbal communication, attentional control, and general fluid intelligence. There is a critical need for interventions to enhance WM. Past efforts, motivated by activation studies, have focused on stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), with mixed results. Here, we supplement these efforts by identifying networks, and connections between them, that are important for WM performance in a large cohort of 539 adults with extensive variability in EF. In fMRI data acquired during performance of an n-back working memory task, we find that the strength of the functional connection between the frontoparietal control network (FPC) and the default mode network (DMN) is correlated with WM accuracy. We build, test, and validate a theory for the modulation of this circuitry that links underlying white matter architecture as measured by diffusion imaging, task-related activation and connectivity as measured by fMRI, and behavioral performance. Building on principles of engineering in network control theory, this theoretical framework identifies a portion of the superior parietal lobe as an effective modulator of the FPC-DMN connection, suggesting its utility as a target for interventions to improve WM performance.</div></div>"], "author": "Submitter Andrew Murphy and Rastko Ciric and Graham Baum and David Roalf and Theodore D Satterthwaite and Danielle S Bassett", "eprint": "https://scholar.google.comhttps://www2.securecms.com/CCNeuro/docs-0/592821d868ed3f49368a40c5.pdf", "title": "The role of network architecture and control in working memory", "url": "https://www2.securecms.com/CCNeuro/docs-0/592821d868ed3f49368a40c5.pdf"}, "id_citations": "siYpAPsAAAAJ:Ri6SYOTghG4C", "source": "citations"}, {"_filled": true, "bib": {"abstract": ["<div class=\"gsh_small\"><div class=\"gsh_csp\">The stochastic block model has recently been employed as a generative graph model for real-world networks in a variety of fields including neuroscience [2].

For the one-third of epilepsy patients whose seizures are refractory to medication, effective therapy relies on reliably localizing where seizures originate and spread. This clinical practice amounts to delineating the epileptic network through neural sensors recording the electrocorticogram. Mapping functional architecture in the epileptic network is promising for objectively localizing cortical targets for therapy in cases of neocortical refractory epilepsy, where post-surgical seizure freedom is unfavorable when cortical structures responsible for generating seizures are difficult to delineate. In this work, we develop and apply network models for analyzing and interrogating the role of fine-grain functional architecture during epileptic events in human neocortical networks. We first develop and validate a model for objectively identifying regions of the epileptic network that drive seizure dynamics. We then develop and validate a model for disentangling network pathways traversed during``normal''function from pathways that drive seizures. Lastly, we devise and apply a novel platform for predicting network response to targeted lesioning of neocortical structures, revealing key control areas that influence the spread of seizures to broader network regions. The outcomes of this work demonstrate network models can objectively identify and predict targets for treating neocortical epilepsy, blueprint potential control strategies to limit seizure spread, and are poised for further validation prior to near-term clinical translation.</div></div>"], "author": "Ankit Narendra Khambhati and Ann Arbor and Brian Litt and Danielle S Bassett and Daniel D Lee and Timothy H Lucas", "title": "Abstract/Details", "url": "http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4504845152973176057&hl=en&oi=scholarr"}, "id_citations": "siYpAPsAAAAJ:hkOj_22Ku90C", "source": "citations"}, {"_filled": true, "bib": {"abstract": ["<div class=\"gsh_small\"><div class=\"gsh_csp\">As discussed in the main manuscript and shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 for a Watts-Strogatz network, the range of values spanned by the path length and clustering coefficient decreases with increasing network density. Here we define the range of clustering or path length to be the difference between its value in lattice and random networks, 1-C (p= 1)/C (p= 0) or 1-L (p= 1)/L (p= 0). In the main manuscript, we present results showing calculations of the SWP and small-world index for network densities in the range 0-20%. At a network density of 20%, we can see that the path length only spans approximately 30% of its original range. Furthermore, by the point at which the density increases to 40%, the path length is the same in lattice and random networks. This implies that the concept of a Watts-Strogatz small-world network is ill-defined for these networks of higher densities, and caution should be used when trying to impose this formalism on high density networks. The effect of network density on path length and clustering further increases the need to take edge weights into account when quantifying network structure. If a network with many weak connections is binarized, the density of the network can become quite high which influences measurements of network properties.</div></div>"], "author": "Sarah Feldt Muldoon and Eric W Bridgeford and Danielle S Bassett", "eprint": "https://scholar.google.comhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0642/e0c3377d8799c9fbe6cffad864f591fc5181.pdf", "title": "Supplementary Information for \u201cSmall-World Propensity and Weighted Brain Networks\u201d", "url": "https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0642/e0c3377d8799c9fbe6cffad864f591fc5181.pdf"}, "id_citations": "siYpAPsAAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC", "source": "citations"}, {"_filled": true, "bib": {"abstract": ["<div class=\"gsh_small\"><div class=\"gsh_csp\">Consistent with our previous work (1), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses of total tau (T-tau) and beta amyloid (A\u03b2) were obtained and evaluated with either a sandwich ELISA 2 (INNOTEST, Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) or a LUMINEX xMAP platform (INNO-BIA AlzBio3, Innogenetics).

To tune our models, we estimated the empirical relationship between connection density and distance, hereafter referred to as connection probability drop-off, from the brain data. We observed that the probability drop-off of connections that lay within a single hemisphere displayed significantly different behavior than the probability drop-off of connections that lay between hemispheres. We did not observe systematic differences between the connection probability drop-off in the two hemispheres, and therefore treat all within-hemispheric connections identically without distinguishing connections that lay in the left hemisphere from connections that lay in the right hemisphere.
