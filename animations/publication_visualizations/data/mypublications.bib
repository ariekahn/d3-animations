abstract={Cognitive function is driven by dynamic interactions between large-scale neural circuits or networks, enabling behaviour. However, fundamental principles constraining these dynamic network processes have remained elusive. Here we use tools from control and network theories to offer a mechanistic explanation for how the brain moves between cognitive states drawn from the network organization of white matter microstructure. Our results suggest that densely connected areas, particularly in the default mode system, facilitate the movement of the brain to many easily reachable states. Weakly connected areas, particularly in cognitive control systems, facilitate the movement of the brain to difficult-to-reach states. Areas located on the boundary between network communities, particularly in attentional control systems, facilitate the integration or segregation of diverse cognitive systems. Our results suggest that structural network differences between cognitive circuits dictate their distinct roles in controlling trajectories of brain network function.},

abstract={The human brain is organized into large-scale functional modules that have been shown to evolve in childhood and adolescence. However, it remains unknown whether the underlying white matter architecture is similarly refined during development, potentially allowing for improvements in executive function. In a sample of 882 participants (ages 8-22) who underwent diffusion imaging as part of?the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we?demonstrate that structural network modules become more segregated with age, with weaker connections between modules and stronger connections within modules. Evolving modular topology facilitates global network efficiency and is driven by age-related strengthening of hub edges present both within and between modules. Critically, both modular segregation and network efficiency are associated with enhanced executive performance and mediate the improvement of executive functioning with age. Together, results delineate a process of structural network maturation that supports executive function in youth.},

title={Structural Pathways Supporting Swift Acquisition of New Visuomotor Skills},

publisher={oup},
volume={27},
number={1},
pages={173-184},
abstract={Human skill learning requires fine-scale coordination of distributed networks of brain regions linked by white matter tracts to allow for effective information transmission. Yet how individual differences in these anatomical pathways may impact individual differences in learning remains far from understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that individual differences in structural organization of networks supporting task performance predict individual differences in the rate at which humans learn a visuomotor skill. Over the course of 6 weeks, 20 healthy adult subjects practiced a discrete sequence production task, learning a sequence of finger movements based on discrete visual cues. We collected structural imaging data, and using deterministic tractography generated structural networks for each participant to identify streamlines connecting cortical and subcortical brain regions. We observed that increased white matter connectivity linking early visual regions was associated with a faster learning rate. Moreover, the strength of multiedge paths between motor and visual modules was also correlated with learning rate, supporting the potential role of extended sets of polysynaptic connections in successful skill acquisition. Our results demonstrate that estimates of anatomical connectivity from white matter microstructure can be used to predict future individual differences in the capacity to learn a new motor-visual skill, and that these predictions are supported both by direct connectivity in visual cortex and indirect connectivity between visual cortex and motor cortex.},

title={Inter-regional ECoG correlations predicted by communication dynamics, geometry, and correlated gene expression},
journal={arXiv},
year={2017},
abstract={Electrocorticography (ECoG) provides direct measurements of synchronized postsynaptic potentials at the exposed cortical surface. Patterns of signal covariance across ECoG sensors have been associated with diverse cognitive functions and remain a critical marker of seizure onset, progression, and termination. Yet, a systems level understanding of these patterns (or networks) has remained elusive, in part due to variable electrode placement and sparse cortical coverage. Here, we address these challenges by constructing inter-regional ECoG networks from multi-subject recordings, demonstrate similarities between these networks and those constructed from blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging, and predict network topology from anatomical connectivity, interregional distance, and correlated gene expression patterns. Our models accurately predict out-of-sample ECoG networks and perform well even when fit to data from individual subjects, suggesting shared organizing principles across persons. In addition, we identify a set of genes whose brain-wide co-expression is highly correlated with ECoG network organization. Using gene ontology analysis, we show that these same genes are enriched for membrane and ion channel maintenance and function, suggesting a molecular underpinning of ECoG connectivity. Our findings provide fundamental understanding of the factors that influence interregional ECoG networks, and open the possibility for predictive modeling of surgical outcomes in disease.},

pages={12733},
abstract={Network science has emerged as a powerful tool through which we can study the higher-order architectural properties of the world around us. How human learners exploit this information remains an essential question. Here, we focus on the temporal constraints that govern such a process. Participants viewed a continuous sequence of images generated by three distinct walks on a modular network. Walks varied along two critical dimensions: their predictability and the density with which they sampled from communities of images. Learners exposed to walks that richly sampled from each community exhibited a sharp increase in processing time upon entry into a new community. This effect was eliminated in a highly regular walk that sampled exhaustively from images in short, successive cycles (i.e., that increasingly minimized uncertainty about the nature of upcoming stimuli). These results demonstrate that temporal organization plays an essential role in learners' sensitivity to the network architecture underlying sensory input.},

title={Cliques and cavities in the human connectome},
journal={Journal of Computational Neuroscience},
year={2017},
pages={1-31},
abstract={Encoding brain regions and their connections as a network of nodes and edges captures many of the possible paths along which information can be transmitted as humans process and perform complex behaviors. Because cognitive processes involve large, distributed networks of brain areas, principled examinations of multi-node routes within larger connection patterns can offer fundamental insights into the complexities of brain function. Here, we investigate both densely connected groups of nodes that could perform local computations as well as larger patterns of interactions that would allow for parallel processing. Finding such structures necessitates that we move from considering exclusively pairwise interactions to capturing higher order relations, concepts naturally expressed in the language of algebraic topology. These tools can be used to study mesoscale network structures that arise from the arrangement of densely connected substructures called cliques in otherwise sparsely connected brain networks. We detect cliques (all-to-all connected sets of brain regions) in the average structural connectomes of 8 healthy adults scanned in triplicate and discover the presence of more large cliques than expected in null networks constructed via wiring minimization, providing architecture through which brain network can perform rapid, local processing. We then locate topological cavities of different dimensions, around which information may flow in either diverging or converging patterns. These cavities exist consistently across subjects, differ from those observed in null model networks, and - importantly - link regions of early and late evolutionary origin in long loops, underscoring their unique role in controlling brain function. These results offer a first demonstration that techniques from algebraic topology offer a novel perspective on structural connectomics, highlighting loop-like paths as crucial features in the human brain's structural architecture.},

title={Role of graph architecture in controlling dynamical networks with applications to neural systems},
journal={Nature Physics},
year={2017},
abstract={Networked systems display complex patterns of interactions between components. In physical networks, these interactions often occur along structural connections that link components in a hard-wired connection topology, supporting a variety of system-wide dynamical behaviours such as synchronization. Although descriptions of these behaviours are important, they are only a first step towards understanding and harnessing the relationship between network topology and system behaviour. Here, we use linear network control theory to derive accurate closed-form expressions that relate the connectivity of a subset of structural connections (those linking driver nodes to non-driver nodes) to the minimum energy required to control networked systems. To illustrate the utility of the mathematics, we apply this approach to high-resolution connectomes recently reconstructed from Drosophila, mouse, and human brains. We use these principles to suggest an advantage of the human brain in supporting diverse network dynamics with small energetic costs while remaining robust to perturbations, and to perform clinically accessible targeted manipulation of the brain's control performance by removing single edges in the network. Generally, our results ground the expectation of a control system's behaviour in its network architecture, and directly inspire new directions in network analysis and design via distributed control.},

title={Network constraints on learnability of probabilistic motor sequences},
journal={arXiv},
year={2017},
abstract={Human learners are adept at grasping the complex relationships underlying incoming sequential input. In the present work, we formalize complex relationships as graph structures derived from temporal associations in motor sequences. Next, we explore the extent to which learners are sensitive to key variations in the topological properties inherent to those graph structures. Participants performed a probabilistic motor sequence task in which the order of button presses was determined by the traversal of graphs with modular, lattice-like, or random organization. Graph nodes each represented a unique button press and edges represented a transition between button presses. Results indicate that learning, indexed here by participants' response times, was strongly mediated by the graph's meso-scale organization, with modular graphs being associated with shorter response times than random and lattice graphs. Moreover, variations in a node's number of connections (degree) and a node's role in mediating long-distance communication (betweeness centrality) impacted graph learning, even after accounting for level of practice on that node. These results demonstrate that the graph architecture underlying temporal sequences of stimuli fundamentally constrain learning, and moreover that tools from network science provide a valuable framework for assessing how learners encode complex, temporally structured information.},

title={Individual Differences in Learning Social and Non-Social Network Structures},
journal={arXiv},
year={2017},
abstract={Learning about complex associations between pieces of information enables individuals to quickly adjust their expectations and develop mental models. Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on these learning processes. Implications for how people learn and adapt to new social contexts that require integration into a new social network are discussed.},
